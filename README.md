Note: The program files are compiled using VS Code with code-runner extension and not using turboC so to compile code in TurboC you might need to add `<conio.h>` `clrscr()` `getch()`

## Linux commands

`cd Desktop/` - change working directory

`touch hello.c` - create a file named 'hello.c' on desktop

`gcc hello.c -o out` - compile the 'hello.c' file in out

`./out` - run c file
